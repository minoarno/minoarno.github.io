     <strong>Underworld Overseer</strong> is so far my favourite project to date.<br/>
     I worked on it from December 2022 till March 2025 from start to finish at <strong>Myron Games</strong> with 10 people.<br/>
     The game was made in <strong>Unity</strong> and we used <strong>Plastic SCM</strong> for version control.<br/>
     To communicate clearly in the team, we adopted an agile sprint planning style using <strong>Notion</strong>.<br/>
     It is a dungeon managing game where we took some inspiration from both the old "Dungeon Keeper" games as well as "War For The Overworld" but with a <strong>focus on VR</strong>.<br/>
     The game was published on October 31 2024 on:
     <ul>
     <li><a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/underworld-overseer/7249464208476495/" target="_blank">Underworld Overseer on Meta</a><br/></li>   
     <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2909910/Underworld_Overseer/" target="_blank">Underworld Overseer on Steam</a><br/></li>
     </ul>
     <br/>
     The game required me to be part of designing the code structure, file structure and planning a whole code base from scratch.<br/>
      it was quite challenging to make shaders or (graphics) optimizations to suit the hardware limitations of the VR Quest 2 on standalone.<br/>  
     In this article I will mainly talk about some of the challenges and some of the things I enjoyed when working on <strong>Underworld Overseer</strong>.<br/>

        My contributions to the project were mostly involving:
        <ul>
        <li>Code Structure</li>
        Since resources were stretched a little thin at times I was mostly in charge of implementing the gameplay loop after discussing it with the lead programmer.<br/>
        Here I learned that naming variables or methods isn't my strong suit and that asking another programmer's opinion about a name prevents misunderstandings immensely down the line.<br/>
        <br/>
        <li>Unit Behavior</li>
        Most of the time I would be tweaking the behavior of the creatures.<br/>
        Whether it would be adding a new mechanic such as eating mandrakes or adding a new enemy behavior.<br/>
        We made use of UML to document how the classes would interact with each other as well as documenting how the enemy and unit AI would function.<br/>
        <br/>
        <li>Optimizing For Quest 2</li>
        One of the problems with VR is the limited capabilities of the hardware you are working with compared to a computer or console.<br/>
        Slight changes in the renderer would make it so that using the depth buffer was not possible for example.<br/>
        It also means that the amount of drawcalls needed to be decreased and that detecting nearby creatures had to be done with performance in mind.<br/>
        <br/>
        <li>Custom Fog</li>
        Another issue is that the culling of objects far away was not only quite noticable but the fog in unity appears to be rectangular.<br/>
        To fix this I made a subshader that implements my own variant of fog.<br/>
        We really wanted a fog that would start at a variable range which would get exponentially thicker while getting closer to another variable.<br/>
        These values could be tweaked and changed at runtime, allowing us to test quicker or limit the render distance for weaker hardware with less popping of meshes.<br/>
        <br/>
        <li>Vertex Animation Texture</li>
        The amount of draw calls would still limit us to do certain things as each animator is it's own draw call.<br/>
        To allow us some simple animations we are making use of a <strong>Vertex Animation Texture</strong> where we use the texture to store vertex offsets.<br/>
        This allows us to turn a bunch of different simple animations into a single material and draw call.</br>   
        </ul>

        <strong>Deisim</strong> is the game that just released when I started my internship in September 2022.<br/>
        It is a God simulator in <strong>VR</strong> made in <strong>Unity</strong> that has been in development since 2016.<br/>
        We made use of <strong>GitKraken</strong> for version control at first and merged the project to <strong>Plastic SCM</strong> later.
        When it comes to t 
        My job was primarily to maintain the existing code base, add new features for future updates and refactoring where needed to allow for more options.<br/>

        Some of the features I've contributed to:
        <ul>
        <li>Vehicle Behavior</li>
        I was in charge of designing and implementing how ships, airships and spaceshuttles would move through the world.<br/>
        Whether they go from port to port to trade or pirates hunting and plundering traders. <br/>
        <br/>
        <li>Coast Manager</li>
        To add some more variety between coasts and to make a difference between dirt, sand and docks, we added the coast manager.<br/>
        Where we made use of scriptable objects to make it easier to maintain.<br/>
        <br/>
        <li>Terrain Blending Shader</li>
        The old blending was made to only supported blending between snow, grass and sand.<br/>
        I refactored it so that we could use more different colors for our terrain tiles but also that they all would have this jagged line no matter the combination.<br/>
        <br/>

        <strong>Banana Wars</strong> is a small chaotic couch co-op game where the goal is to gain as many bananas as possible.<br/>
        The goal of the project was to make a game in groups of 4 during a single semester while only being allowed 4 hours to work on each week.<br/>
        This gave us a good sense of deadlines and teaching us how to plan a project using <a href="https://hacknplan.com/" target="_blank">hacknplan</a>.

        <br/>
        <li>Collecting Patient Data</li>
        The specialists wanted to collect data such as:

            <li> How long does it take to finish a parcour compared to last time?</li><br/>
            <li> How often are they looking at the joystick?</li><br/>
            <li> How many times do they bump into a wall/object while driving?</li><br/>

        All of this data was saved into an excel file for easy access for the specialists.<br/>
        <li>URP Shaders</li>
        I also learned how to use HLSL and GLSL in Unity's URP.<br/>
