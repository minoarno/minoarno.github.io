                This project was made for the graphics programming 2 course at DAE.</br>
                For the demonstration of the features of the engine, I made a little student game using assets of "Zelda Wind Waker" from Nintendo.</br>
                This project is purely for educational purposes on how engines and DirectX11 works.</br>

                <li>PhysX Physics</li>
                <li>Deferred Rendering</li>

            In the video above there is a specific shader used for the sea.</br>
            To create it I first made it in Unity and then tried recreating it in the engine using the depthbuffer.</br>
