     <strong>Underworld Overseer</strong> is so far my favourite project to date.<br/>
     I worked on it from December 2022 till March 2025 from start to finish at <strong>Myron Games</strong> with 10 people.<br/>
     The game was made in <strong>Unity</strong> and we used <strong>Plastic SCM</strong> for version control.<br/>
     To communicate clearly in the team, we adopted an agile sprint planning style using <strong>Notion</strong>.<br/>
     It is a dungeon managing game where we took some inspiration from both the old "Dungeon Keeper" games as well as "War For The Overworld" but with a <strong>focus on VR</strong>.<br/>
     The game was published on October 31 2024 on:
     <ul>

     </ul>
     <br/>
     The game required me to be part of designing the code structure, file structure and planning a whole code base from scratch.<br/>
     It was quite challenging to make shaders or (graphics) optimizations to suit the hardware limitations of the VR Quest 2 on standalone.<br/>  
     In this article I will mainly talk about some of the challenges and some of the things I enjoyed when working on <strong>Underworld Overseer</strong>.<br/>

        My contributions to the project were mostly involving:
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Code Structure</strong></li>
        Since resources were stretched a little thin at times, I was mostly in charge of implementing the gameplay loop after discussing it with the lead programmer.<br/>
        Here I learned that naming variables or methods isn't my strong suit and that asking another programmer's opinion about a name prevents misunderstandings immensely down the line.<br/>
        <br/>
        <li><strong>Unit Behavior</strong></li>
        Most of the time I would be tweaking the behavior of the creatures.<br/>
        Whether it would be adding a new mechanic such as eating mandrakes or adding a new enemy behavior.<br/>
        We made use of UML to document how the classes would interact with each other as well as documenting how the enemy and unit AI would function.<br/>
        <br/>
        <li><strong>Optimizing For Quest 2</strong></li>
        One of the problems with VR is the limited capabilities of the hardware you are working with compared to a computer or console.<br/>
        Slight changes in the renderer would make it so that using the depth buffer was not possible for example.<br/>
        It also means that the amount of drawcalls needed to be decreased and that detecting nearby creatures had to be done with performance in mind.<br/>
        <br/>
        <li><strong>Custom Fog</strong></li>
        Another issue is that the culling of objects far away was not only quite noticable but the fog in unity appears to be rectangular.<br/>
        To fix this I made a <strong>subshader</strong> that implements my own variant of fog.<br/>
        We really wanted a fog that would start at a variable range which would get exponentially thicker while getting closer to another variable.<br/>
        These values could be tweaked and changed at runtime, allowing us to test quicker or limit the render distance for weaker hardware with less popping of meshes.<br/>
        <br/>
        <li><strong>Vertex Animation Texture</strong></li>
        The amount of draw calls would still limit us to do certain things as each animator is it's own draw call.<br/>
        To allow us some simple animations, we are making use of a <strong>Vertex Animation Texture</strong>, where we use the texture to store vertex offsets.<br/>
        This allows us to turn a bunch of different simple animations into a single material and draw call.</br>
        </ul>

        <strong>Deisim</strong> is the game that just released when I started my internship in September 2022.<br/>
        It is a God simulator in <strong>VR</strong> made in <strong>Unity</strong> that has been in development since 2016.<br/>
        We made use of <strong>GitKraken</strong> for version control at first and merged the project to <strong>Plastic SCM</strong> later.<br/>
        For communication we tried a variety of agile planning tools such as <strong>Codecks</strong> and eventually <strong>Notion</strong>.<br/>
        The game released on:

        My job was primarily to maintain the existing code base, add new features for future updates and refactoring where needed to allow for more options.<br/>

        Some of the features I've contributed to:
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Vehicle Behavior</strong></li>
        I was in charge of designing and implementing how ships, airships and spaceshuttles would move through the world.<br/>
        Whether they go from port to port to trade or pirates hunting and plundering traders. <br/>
        <br/>
        <li><strong>Coast Manager</strong></li>
        To add some more variety between coasts and to make a difference between dirt, sand and docks, we added the coast manager.<br/>
        Where we made use of scriptable objects to make it easier to maintain.<br/>
        <br/>
        <li><strong>Terrain Blending Shader</strong></li>
        The old blending was made to only supported blending between snow, grass and sand.<br/>
        I refactored it so that we could use more different colors for our terrain tiles but also that they all would have this jagged line no matter the combination.<br/>
        <br/>

        <strong>Banana Wars</strong> is a small chaotic couch co-op game where the goal is to gain as many bananas as possible.<br/>
        The project is made in <strong>Unity</strong> with 3 other people between February 2020 and June 2020.<br/>
        We used <strong>Perforce</strong> for source control and <strong>Hacknplan</strong> for planning.<br/>
        It feels more like a gamejam game to the limited amount of time we could spend on development each week.<br/>

        <strong>Zombie Survivor AI</strong> is a game where it was an exam from <strong>DAE</strong>, where you would have to write an AI that would play the game for us using code injection.<br/>

        For version control I made use of <strong>Github</strong>.

    Here you can see a visual representation of the player AI's thought process in <strong>UML</strong>.<br/>
    Since the goal is to survive as long as possible and the zombies get stronger the longer you stay alive.<br/>
    After a while food also starts to become a problem, hence the reason why exploring is a necessity.<br/>
    All the movement of the player is handled using <strong>steering behaviors</strong>.<br/>

        <strong>Vanilla, Wheelchair Simulator</strong> is a school project where we worked together with <strong>UZ Ghent</strong> to create a <strong>VR</strong> game that mimics an electronic wheelchair.<br/>
        It's made in <strong>Unity</strong> and we used <strong>Perforce</strong> for version control.<br/>
        The development team consisted of 6 students from <strong>DAE</strong>, where the teachers would supervise as leads twice a week.</br>
        <br/>
        This project was a collaboration with the patients and the specialists.</br>
        We would then have to adjust the game based of the biweekly feedback.</br>
        The goal was to make a training simulation for people that are paraplegic or tetraplegic and would require an electronic wheelchair for their daily lives.<br/>

        <li><strong>Realistic Wheelchair Movement</strong></li>
        The specialists and patients tested the controls to make sure that the feel felt authentic.<br/>
        <br/>
        <li><strong>Collecting Patient Data</strong></li>
        The specialists wanted to collect data such as:
        <ul> 
            <li> How long does it take to finish a set route compared to last time?</li>
            <li> How often are they looking at the joystick?</li>
            <li> How many times do they bump into a wall/object while driving?</li>

        All of this data was saved into an excel file for easy access for the specialists.<br/>
        <br/>
        <li><strong>URP Shaders</strong></li>
        Sometimes I had to adapt the shaders inside of <strong>HLSL</strong> and <strong>GLSL</strong> in <strong>Unity's URP</strong> because shadergraph was lacking a node.<br/>
        Working with the necessary buffers and utilizing property blocks where needed.</br>
